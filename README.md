## Setup Procedure

### Database Setup

This project uses Docker and Docker-compose to set up a PostgreSQL database. Follow these instructions to configure the database with environment-specific credentials.

#### Step 1: Create a `.env` File

In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
export POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
export POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
export SUPERADMIN_USERNAME=superadmin
export SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=superadminpassword
```

- Quick Tip: Use `"'var_name'"` to have `'var_name'`in real script.

#### Step 2: Substitude Placeholder by Your `.env` File Setting

```bash
POSTGRES_USER --> username of db admin (complete permission)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD --> password of db admin
POSTGRES_DB --> name of db
SUPERADMIN_USERNAME --> name of super admin user (for account management)
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD --> password of super admin user
```

#### Step 3: Start Postgres Docker

```bash
$ make start-db
```

More details about easier control over postgres container see [script](#script).


## Script

### Using the Makefile for Docker Management

This projectâ€™s Makefile provides convenient commands for managing Docker containers for the entire project and the PostgreSQL database separately. Below are the commands and how to use them.

### Whole Project Commands

These commands control all containers in the Docker Compose setup, including Nginx, the Go backend, and PostgreSQL.

1. **Start the Project**:
   - Starts all containers in the project.
   ```bash
   $ make start-project
   ```

2. **Stop the Project**:
   - Stops all containers in the project.
   ```bash
   $ make start-project
   ```

3. **Restart the Project**:
   - Stops and removes all containers ***without touching mount data***, rebuilds them, and starts them up with the latest changes.
    ```bash
    $ make restart-project
    ```

3. **Reset the Project**:
   - Stops and removes all containers ***and their mount data***, rebuilds them, and starts them up with the latest changes.
    ```bash
    $ make reset-project
    ```

### PostgreSQL-Specific Commands

These commands only control the PostgreSQL container, useful if you need to restart or reset the database independently of the other containers.

1. **Start PostgreSQL**:
    - Starts only the PostgreSQL container.
    ```bash
    $ make start-db
    ```

2. **Stop PostgreSQL**:
    - Stops only the PostgreSQL container.
    ```bash
    $ make stop-db
    ```

3. **Rebuild PostgreSQL with Fresh Data**:
    - Stops the PostgreSQL container, removes any existing data, and starts a fresh instance with the initial data.
    ```bash
    $ make reset-db
    ```

4. **Access the PostgreSQL Shell**:
    - Opens an interactive psql shell for accessing the PostgreSQL database directly. Use this to run SQL commands manually.
    ```bash
    $ make db-shell
    ```

### Important Notes

- **Permissions**: All commands use `sudo` to ensure Docker commands have the necessary permissions. You may modify `sudo` if your Docker setup does not require it.
- **Rebuilding Containers**: Use the `reset-project` and `reset-db` commands carefully, as they will recreate the containers and potentially reset the database.
- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure the `.env` file is configured correctly with your environment variables before starting the project.
