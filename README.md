## Setup Procedure

This project uses Docker and Docker-compose to set up Nginx, GO backend, React Web and PostgreSQL database. 

Follow the following instructions to configure the docker with environment-specific variables.


### Step 1: Create a `.env` File

In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
export POSTGRES_USER=Username --> username of db admin (complete permission)
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Password --> password of db admin
export POSTGRES_DB=DBname --> name of db
export SUPERADMIN_USERNAME=Adminname --> name of super admin user (for account management)
export SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=Adminpassword --> password of super admin user
export IP_ADDRESS=localhost --> standard ipv4 address
```

***!!Notice***: `--> etc` are comments for understanding, do not enter them into `.env` file.

- Quick Tip: Use `"'var_name'"` to have `'var_name'`in real script.
- `IP_ADDRESS` is used for testing, CORS will become same origin if using build static page.


### Step 2: Change ports in `docker-compose.yml`

Change port `- "80:80"` (external : inside docker) in `nginx:` to fit your needs.


### Step 3: Build React web

- Change `baseURL` to your real serving IP in `frontend/api.js`.
- ```/frontend$ npm run build``` to build React web into static.


### Step 4: Build docker

Run `make start-project`. 

Details about make commands, please read next section [Script](#script).


### Tips

- Remember to `$ make restart-project` every time you made any changes and want to see its effect, it will rebuild the docker with the change you made.
- During test time, you can use `$ npm start` to have hot-update development React, but be careful about any IP settings for CORS problem.


## Script

### Using the Makefile for Docker Management

This projectâ€™s Makefile provides convenient commands for managing Docker containers for the entire project and the PostgreSQL database separately. Below are the commands and how to use them.

### Whole Project Commands

These commands control all containers in the Docker Compose setup, including Nginx, the Go backend, and PostgreSQL.

1. **Start the Project**:
   - Starts all containers in the project.
   ```bash
   $ make start-project
   ```

2. **Stop the Project**:
   - Stops all containers in the project.
   ```bash
   $ make start-project
   ```

3. **Restart the Project**:
   - Stops and removes all containers ***without touching mount data***, rebuilds them, and starts them up with the latest changes.
    ```bash
    $ make restart-project
    ```

3. **Reset the Project**:
   - Stops and removes all containers ***and their mount data***, rebuilds them, and starts them up with the latest changes.
    ```bash
    $ make reset-project
    ```

### PostgreSQL-Specific Commands

These commands only control the PostgreSQL container, useful if you need to restart or reset the database independently of the other containers.

1. **Start PostgreSQL**:
    - Starts only the PostgreSQL container.
    ```bash
    $ make start-db
    ```

2. **Stop PostgreSQL**:
    - Stops only the PostgreSQL container.
    ```bash
    $ make stop-db
    ```

3. **Rebuild PostgreSQL with Fresh Data**:
    - Stops the PostgreSQL container, removes any existing data, and starts a fresh instance with the initial data.
    ```bash
    $ make reset-db
    ```

4. **Access the PostgreSQL Shell**:
    - Opens an interactive psql shell for accessing the PostgreSQL database directly. Use this to run SQL commands manually.
    ```bash
    $ make db-shell
    ```

### Important Notes

- **Permissions**: All commands use `sudo` to ensure Docker commands have the necessary permissions. You may modify `sudo` if your Docker setup does not require it.
- **Rebuilding Containers**: Use the `reset-project` and `reset-db` commands carefully, as they will recreate the containers and potentially reset the database.
- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure the `.env` file is configured correctly with your environment variables before starting the project.
